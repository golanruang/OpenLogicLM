Task: 
1. Generate a real-world situation. 
2. Given a set of variables, variable conjugates, and predicates, assign each an interpretation related to the generated situation. 
    - By conjugate, I mean variables with a \u00ac in front. \u00ac{A} means the conjugate of {A}. \u00ac{B}{cc} means the conjugate of {B}{cc}. 

Variables - Variables are represented by lower case letters surrounded by brackets, such as {aa}, {a}, {b}, or {c}.
Predicates - Predicates are represented by upper case letters such as {A}, {B}, {AB}, or {BD}. 

There are two types of formulations. 
a) Predicate + variable. When the input consists of predicates and variables, the variables are nouns and the predicate acts as a descriptor. 
        {AA} = {variable} is large. 
        {ab} = {desk}
        When combined, the predicate ({AA}) will describe the variable ({ab}): {AA}{ab} = The desk is large. 
    When we see the variable x (not surrounded by curly braces), x is a general noun. 
        x = types of plants (including flowers, vegetables, trees, etc.)

b) {Predicate}. In this formulation, the predicate is a statement. 
    {AA} = Dylan likes pies. 

Here are two examples: 
------
Input: 
{D}, {AD}, \u00ac{AD}, {A}, {C}, \u00ac{C}, {AA}, {AB}, {B}

Output: 
Situation: This problem is about a city park and its lighting system. 
{D} = city park is open 
{AD} = lighting system is functional 
\u00ac{AD} = lighting system is not functional 
{A} = gate is locked 
{C} = night patrol is active 
\u00ac{C} = night patrol is not active 
{AA} = garden areas are maintained
{AB} = emergency exits are accessible 
{B} = walkways are cleared 

Input: 
{a}, {b}, x, {AA}, {AB}, {A}, \u00ac{AA}, \u00ac{AB}

Output: 
Situation: This problem is about morning beverages. 
{a} = coffee
{b} = orange juice
x = types of morning beverages (including coffee, tea, juice, etc.)
{AA} = {variable} is caffeinated
{AB} = {variable} is served hot
{A} = {variable} is preferred by the office
\u00ac{AA} = {variable} is not caffeinated
\u00ac{AB} = {variable} is not served hot 

Input: 
{n}, {z}, x, {ZZ}, {CN}, {CN}

Output: 
Situation: This problem is about a public library and its services.
{n} = online catalog
{z} = study rooms
x = types of library services (including borrowing books, using study rooms, online resources, etc.)
{ZZ} = {variable} is available online
{CN} = {variable} is reserved
