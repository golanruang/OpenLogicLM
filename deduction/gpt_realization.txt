Task: given a formula for a deductive reasoning problem, realize the problem by giving every variable and predicate a unique real world meaning. Maintain the original logic of the formula. Do NOT give multiple variables or predicates the same meaning.
Each formula is made of two parts: 
1. Variables - Variables are represented by lower case letters surrounded by brackets, such as {aa}, {a}, {b}, or {c}.
    - Variables are real-world objects, such as wands, computers, or play-dough. 
2. Predicates are represented by upper case letters such as {A}, {B}, {AB}, or {BD}. For predicates, there are two cases: 
    a) The predicate describes a variable. This occurs when a variable immediately follows a predicate, like {AA}{a}, {AB}{c}, {DF}{s}, or {LS}{y}. In this case, the predicate will describe the variable. 
    For example: 
        {AA}{a} could mean the frog is red, where {AA} describes a variable as red, and {a} is a frog. 
        {AB}{c} could mean the wand is shattered, where {AB} describes a variable as shattered, and {c} is a wand.
        {DF}{s} could mean the Logan craves candy, where {DF} describes a variable as something Logan craves, and {s} is a candy.
    b) The predicate is a statement. This occurs when a variable does not follow a predicate, like {AA}, {AB}, {DF}, or {LS}. In this case, the predicate will be a statement. 
    For example: 
        {CD} could mean the statement - Doug likes green apples.
        {O} could mean the statement - I work with NLP 
        {A} could mean the statement - Water bottles are heavy. 

Note: 
\u00ac represents the conjugate, or opposite of a statement 
In this pattern -> (x): {A}x -> \u00ac(\u00ac{N}x & \u00ac{BF}x)
- This means for any x 
(Ex) means there exists an x
- where x is an abstract variable  

There are three parts of each problem: 
1. Hypothesis: This is what we are trying to prove. 
2. Context: These are pieces of information we must use (or not use) to prove our hypothesis. 
3. Proof: This is how we will combine the information from the context to prove our hypothesis.

Here some section-by-section examples:

"proof": "sent7 & assump1 -> int1: Burgers are not healthy and hotdogs are not yummy."

For this problem, let's assign real-world meanings to each variable and predicate as follows:

Variables:

{b} = smartphone
{a} = laptop
{x} = electronic devices in general
Predicates:

{A} = is turned on
\u00ac{A} = 
{B} = is charged
{AA} = has internet connectivity
{AB} = has sufficient battery life
{N} = is in silent mode
{BF} = is in airplane mode
Now, let's translate the given template into a real-world context with these assignments:


(x): {A}x -> \u00ac(\u00ac{N}x & \u00ac{BF}x)
"For every electronic device, if it is turned on, then it is not (in silent mode and in airplane mode)."

"Hypothesis": "(The smartphone is not turned on and is charged)."

"Context":
"If the laptop is not charged, then it is not true that (the smartphone is not charged and is turned on)."
"If the laptop is not turned on, then it is not true that (the smartphone is not turned on and is charged)."
"There exists an electronic device that is not (without internet connectivity and without sufficient battery life)."
"For every electronic device, if it is not (without internet connectivity and without sufficient battery life), then the laptop is not turned on."
"If the smartphone is not turned on, then it is not true that (the laptop is turned on and is charged)."
"For every electronic device, if it is turned on, then it is not (in silent mode and in airplane mode)."
"It is not true that (the smartphone is turned on and is charged)."
"There exists an electronic device that is not (turned on and not charged)."
