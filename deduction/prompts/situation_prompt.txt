Task: 
1. Generate a real-world situation. 
2. Given a set of subjects, predicates, and predicate conjugates, assign each an interpretation related to the generated situation. 
    
Subjects - Subjects are represented by LOWERCASE letters surrounded by brackets, such as {aa}, {a}, {b}, or {c}.
Predicates - Predicates are represented by UPPERCASE letters such as {A}, {B}, {AB}, or {BD}. 
Predicate Conjugates - \u00ac{A} is the predicate conjugate of {A}. 

There are two types of formulations. 
a) Predicate + subject (THE INPUT CONSISTS OF UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE LETTERS). The predicate should be defined in the form: {variable} ___.  
        Predicate {A} = {variable} is large. 
        Subject {ab} = desk
        When combined, the predicate ({A}) will describe the subject ({ab}): {A}{ab} = The desk is large. 
    x is a general noun. 
        x = types of plants (including flowers, vegetables, trees, etc.)

b) Predicate (THE INPUT CONSISTS OF ONLY UPPERCASE LETTERS). When the input consists of ONLY predicates, the predicate is a statement.
    {AA} = Dylan likes pies. 

Here are two examples: 
------
Example 1: ONLY UPPERCASE LETTERS IN INPUT -> DEFINE PREDICATES AS STATEMENTS
Input: 
{D}, {AD}, \u00ac{AD}, {A}, {C}, \u00ac{C}, {AA}, {AB}, {B}

Output: 
Situation: This problem is about a city park and its lighting system. 
{D} = city park is open 
{AD} = lighting system is functional 
\u00ac{AD} = lighting system is not functional 
{A} = gate is locked 
{C} = night patrol is active 
\u00ac{C} = night patrol is not active 
{AA} = garden areas are maintained
{AB} = emergency exits are accessible 
{B} = walkways are cleared 

Example 2: UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE LETTERS IN INPUT -> DEFINE PREDICATES AS DESCRIPTORS OF FORM {variable} ___. 
Input: 
{a}, {b}, x, {AA}, {AB}, {A}, \u00ac{AA}, \u00ac{AB}

Output: 
Situation: This problem is about morning beverages. 
{a} = coffee
{b} = orange juice
x = types of morning beverages (including coffee, tea, juice, etc.)
{AA} = {variable} is caffeinated
{B} = {variable} is served hot
{A} = {variable} is preferred by the office
\u00ac{AA} = {variable} is not caffeinated
\u00ac{B} = {variable} is not served hot 

Example 3: UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE LETTERS IN INPUT -> DEFINE PREDICATES AS DESCRIPTORS OF FORM {variable} ___. 
Input: 
{n}, {z}, x, {ZZ}, {CN}, {CN}

Output: 
Situation: This problem is about a public library and its services.
{n} = online catalog
{z} = study rooms
x = types of library services (including borrowing books, using study rooms, online resources, etc.)
{ZZ} = {variable} is available online
{CN} = {variable} is reserved

Input: 
[[TEMPLATE]]
