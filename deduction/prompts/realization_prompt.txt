Your task is to realize a logic formula into natural language given the meaning of each variable and predicate and the overall situation. 

Variables - Variables are represented by lower case letters surrounded by brackets, such as {aa}, {a}, {b}, or {c}.
Predicates - Predicates are represented by upper case letters such as {A}, {B}, {AB}, or {BD}. 

There are two types of formulations. 
a) Predicate + variable. When the input consists of predicates and variables, the variables are nouns and the predicate ALWAYS acts as a descriptor of the form {variable} .... 
        {AA} = {variable} is large. 
        {ab} = {desk}
        {AA}{ab} = The desk is large. 

b) {Predicate}. In this formulation, the predicate is a statement. 
    {AA} = Dylan likes pies. 

(Ex) means that there exists an x such that...
(x) is a general noun. For example, 
    x = types of plants (including flowers, vegetables, trees, etc.)

If you encounter a statement like: ¬(¬{G}x & ¬{F}x), this is equivalent to {G}x OR {F}x by DeMorgans Laws.

TODO: incorporate "OR"

Below are some examples. 
------
Ex 1: Using predicates only (UPPERCASE LETTERS ONLY)
Input: 
Situation: This problem is about a city park. 
{A}: city park is open
{C}: lighting system is functional 
{DN}: gate is locked 
{B}: walkways are cleared 
{DD}: fountains are working 
{JI}: night patrol is active 
{AJ}: safety measures are active 
{GF}: visibility is adequate 
{AA}: Recreation areas are accessible 
{AB}: night patrol is active 
{DH}: garden areas are maintained 
{AS}: emergency exits are accessible 
"hypothesis_formula": "({A} & {C})" 
"sent1": "\u00ac{DN}"
"sent2": "\u00ac{B}"
"sent3": "(\u00ac{A} & {B}) -> \u00ac{DD}"
"sent4": "{C}" 
"sent5": "\u00ac{JI} -> \u00ac({AJ} & {GF})"
"sent6": "\u00ac({AA} & \u00ac{AB}) -> {B}"
"sent7": "\u00ac{A} -> \u00ac({AA} & \u00ac{AB})"
"sent8": "{DH}"
"sent9": "{AS}"

Output: 
"hypothesis": "the city park is open and the visibility is adequate."
"sent1": "the gate is not locked." 
"sent2": "the walkways are not cleared." 
"sent3": "if the park is not opened and the walkways are cleared, then the fountains are not working." 
"sent4": "the lighting system is functional." 
"sent5": "If the night patrol is not active, it means that the safety measures and the visibility are not adequate."
"sent6": "If the recreational areas are not accessible and the night patrol is active, the walkways are cleared."
"sent7": "If the park is not open, it means that the recreational areas are not accessible and the night patrol is active."
"sent8": "the garden areas are maintained." 
"sent9": "the emergency exits are accessible." 

Ex 2: Using variables and predicates (UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE)
Input: 
Situation: This problem is about a local community garden.
{a} = tomato plants
{b} = rose bushes
{c} = compost bin
x = types of elements found in a community garden (including plants, flowers, vegetables, trees, compost bins, etc.)
{C} = {variable} needs watering
{D} = {variable} is blooming
{AA} = {variable} attracts bees
{AB} = {variable} is used for educational workshops
{B} = {variable} is newly planted
{A} = {variable} produces vegetables
"hypothesis_formula": "(\u00ac{C}{c} & {D}{c})"
sent1: (\u00ac{AA}{a} & \u00ac{AB}{a}) -> {B}{b}
sent2: (x): \u00ac({B}x & {D}x) -> \u00ac{D}x
sent3: {D}{c}
sent4: \u00ac{A}{c} -> \u00ac{C}{c}
sent5: \u00ac{B}{b}
sent6: \u00ac(\u00ac{AA}{a} & \u00ac{AB}{a}) -> \u00ac{A}{c}

Output: 
"hypothesis": "The compost bin doesn't need watering and is blooming."
"sent1": "If tomato plants do not attract bees and are not used for educational workshops, then rose bushes are newly planted."
"sent2": "For any element in the garden, if it is not newly planted and blooming, then it is not blooming."
"sent3": "The compost bin is blooming."
"sent4": "If the compost bin does not produce vegetables, then it does not need watering."
"sent5": "The rose bushes are not newly planted."
"sent6": "If it is not the case that tomato plants do not attract bees and are not used for educational workshops, then the compost bin does not produce vegetables."

Ex 3: Using variables and predicates (UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE) and (Ex)
Input: 
Situation: This problem is about a school and its facilities.

x = types of school facilities (including classrooms, library, cafeteria, etc.)
{a} = classrooms
{b} = library
{A} = {variable} is under renovation
¬{A} = {variable} is not under renovation
{AA} = {variable} is equipped with air conditioning
{AB} = {variable} is accessible for disabled students
¬{AI} = {variable} is not available for after-school activities
¬{B} = {variable} is not open on weekends
{C} = {variable} is open for evening classes
¬{C} = {variable} is not open for evening classes
¬{D} = {variable} is not equipped with projectors
{D} = {variable} is equipped with projectors
¬{E} = {variable} is not available for community events
{HN} = {variable} has a nurse's office
"hypothesis_formula": "¬{C}{a}"
"sent1": "(Ex): (¬{D}x & ¬{E}x)"
"sent2": "(¬{AI}{a} & {HN}{a}) -> {A}{a}"
"sent3": "(x): ¬(¬{D}x & ¬{E}x) -> {A}{a}" 
"sent4": "(Ex): ¬({D}x & ¬{E}x)"
"sent5": "(x): ¬{A}x -> (¬{B}{b} & {C}{b})"
"sent6": "({AA}{a} & {AB}{a}) -> ¬{B}{a}"
"sent7": "(x): (¬{B}x & {A}x) -> {C}x"
"sent8": "({AA}{a} & {AB}{a})"
"sent9": "(Ex): ¬(¬{D}x & ¬{E}x)" 

Output: 
"hypothesis": "The classrooms are not open for evening classes."
"sent1": "There exists at least one type of school facility that is not equipped with projectors and is not available for community events."
"sent2": "If the classrooms are not available for after-school activities and have a nurse's office, then they are under renovation."
"sent3": "For all types of school facilities, if they are equipped with projects or available for community events, then the classrooms are under renovation." 
"sent4": "There exists at least one type of school facility that is not both equipped with projectors and unavailable for community events."
"sent5": "For any type of school facility, if it is not under renovation, then the library is open on weekends and open for evening classes."
"sent6": "If the classrooms are equipped with air conditioning and accessible for disabled students, then they are not open on weekends."
"sent7": "For all types of school facilities, if they are not open on weekends but are under renovation, then they are open for evening classes."
"sent8": "The classrooms are equipped with air conditioning and are accessible for disabled students."
"sent9": "There exists at least one type of school facility that is equipped with project or available for community events.
