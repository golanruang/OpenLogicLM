Your task is to realize a logic formula into natural language given the meaning of each variable and predicate and the overall situation. 

Variables - Variables are represented by lower case letters surrounded by brackets, such as {aa}, {a}, {b}, or {c}.
Predicates - Predicates are represented by upper case letters such as {A}, {B}, {AB}, or {BD}. 

There are two types of formulations. 
a) Predicate + variable. When the input consists of predicates and variables, the variables are nouns and the predicate ALWAYS acts as a descriptor of the form {variable} .... 
        {AA} = {variable} is large. 
        {ab} = {desk}
        {AA}{ab} = The desk is large. 

b) {Predicate}. In this formulation, the predicate is a statement. 
    {AA} = Dylan likes pies. 

(Ex) means that there exists an x such that...
(x) is a general noun. For example, 
    x = types of plants (including flowers, vegetables, trees, etc.)

Below are some examples. 
------
Ex 1: Using predicates only
Situation: This problem is about a city park. 
{A}: city park is open
{C}: lighting system is functional 
{DN}: gate is locked 
{B}: walkways are cleared 
{DD}: fountains are working 
{JI}: night patrol is active 
{AJ}: safety measures are active 
{GF}: visibility is adequate 
{AA}: Recreation areas are accessible 
{AB}: night patrol is active 
{DH}: garden areas are maintained 
{AS}: emergency exits are accessible 
"hypothesis_formula": "({A} & {C})"
"sent1": "\u00ac{DN}"
"sent2": "\u00ac{B}"
"sent3": "(\u00ac{A} & {B}) -> \u00ac{DD}"
"sent4": "{C}" 
"sent5": "\u00ac{JI} -> \u00ac({AJ} & {GF})"
"sent6": "\u00ac({AA} & \u00ac{AB}) -> {B}"
"sent7": "\u00ac{A} -> \u00ac({AA} & \u00ac{AB})"
"sent8": "{DH}"
"sent9": "{AS}"

Output: 
"hypothesis": "the city park is open and the visibility is adequate."
"sent1": "the gate is not locked." 
"sent2": "the walkways are not cleared." 
"sent3": "if the park is not opened and the walkways are cleared, then the fountains are not working." 
"sent4": "the lighting system is functional." 
"sent5": "If the night patrol is not active, it means that the safety measures and the visibility are not adequate."
"sent6": "If the recreational areas are not accessible and the night patrol is active, the walkways are cleared."
"sent7": "If the park is not open, it means that the recreational areas are not accessible and the night patrol is active."
"sent8": "the garden areas are maintained." 
"sent9": "the emergency exits are accessible."

{b} = goldfish
{ab} = three-pointers
{a} = water
{D} = Matcha loves {variable}
{AD} = Michael shoots {variable} 
{A} = Cows eat {variable} 
{C} = Dumbledorf feeds {variable} 
{AA} = Swedish Fish read {variable}

{B} = Rice needs {variable}
"hypothesis_formula": "{D}{b}"
"sent1": {AD}{ab}
"sent2": (\u00ac{A}{b} & {C}{b}) -> {D}{b}

Output: 


"hypothesis": "Matcha loves XTRA Cheddar Goldfish."
"context_formula": "sent1: Michael shoots three-pointers. sent2: If cows do not eat goldfish and Dumbledorf does feed goldfish, Matcha loves goldfish. sent3: For any object x, if it is not true that Swedish Fish do not read x and cats do not claw x, this means that cows do not eat goldfish. sent4: Rice needs water. sent5: If Swedish Fish do not read water and cats do not claw water, Rice does not need water. sent6: Dumbledorf feeds goldfish.
"proofs": ["void -> assump1: Swedish fish do not read water and cat do not claw water; sent5 & assump1 -> int1: Rice does not need water; int1 & sent4 -> int2: #F#; [assump1] & int2 -> int3: It is not true that Swedish Fish do not read water and cats do not claw water; int3 -> int4: There exists an x such that it is not true that Swedish fish read x and cats claw x; int4 & sent3 -> int5: Cows do not eat goldfish; int5 & sent6 -> int6: Cows do not eat goldfish and Dumbledorf feeds goldfish; int6 & sent2 -> hypothesis;"] 

Ex 3: Using variables and predicates and (Ex)
Situation: This problem is about a local gym and its facilities.
{E} = gym is open for 24 hours
{c} = swimming pool
{C} = swimming pool is closed for maintenance
{a} = treadmill area
{D} = personal training sessions are available
{b} = yoga studio
{B} = yoga studio is booked for a private event
{A} = gym membership is active
x = types of gym facilities (including treadmills, swimming pools, yoga studios, etc.)
{AA} = {variable} is currently crowded
{aa} = locker rooms

Output: 
"hypothesis": "The swimming pool is not open for 24 hours."

Situation: This problem is about morning beverages. 
{AA} = {variable} is caffeinated
{AB} = {variable} is served hot
{A} = {variable} is preferred by the office
{a} = coffee
