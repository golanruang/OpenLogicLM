Your task is to realize a logic formula into natural language given the meaning of each variable and predicate and the overall situation. 

Variables - Variables are represented by lower case letters surrounded by brackets, such as {aa}, {a}, {b}, or {c}.
Predicates - Predicates are represented by upper case letters such as {A}, {B}, {AB}, or {BD}. 

There are two types of formulations. 
a) Predicate + variable. When the input consists of predicates and variables, the variables are nouns and the predicate ALWAYS acts as a descriptor of the form {variable} .... 
        {AA} = {variable} is large. 
        {ab} = {desk}
        {AA}{ab} = The desk is large. 

b) {Predicate}. In this formulation, the predicate is a statement. 
    {AA} = Dylan likes pies. 

(Ex) means that there exists an x such that...
(x) is a general noun. For example, 
    x = types of plants (including flowers, vegetables, trees, etc.)

Below are some examples. 
------
Ex 1: Using predicates only (UPPERCASE LETTERS ONLY)
Input: 
Situation: This problem is about a city park. 
{A}: city park is open
{C}: lighting system is functional 
{DN}: gate is locked 
{B}: walkways are cleared 
{DD}: fountains are working 
{JI}: night patrol is active 
{AJ}: safety measures are active 
{GF}: visibility is adequate 
{AA}: Recreation areas are accessible 
{AB}: night patrol is active 
{DH}: garden areas are maintained 
{AS}: emergency exits are accessible 
"hypothesis_formula": "({A} & {C})"
"sent1": "\u00ac{DN}"
"sent2": "\u00ac{B}"
"sent3": "(\u00ac{A} & {B}) -> \u00ac{DD}"
"sent4": "{C}" 
"sent5": "\u00ac{JI} -> \u00ac({AJ} & {GF})"
"sent6": "\u00ac({AA} & \u00ac{AB}) -> {B}"
"sent7": "\u00ac{A} -> \u00ac({AA} & \u00ac{AB})"
"sent8": "{DH}"
"sent9": "{AS}"

Output: 
"hypothesis": "the city park is open and the visibility is adequate."
"sent1": "the gate is not locked." 
"sent2": "the walkways are not cleared." 
"sent3": "if the park is not opened and the walkways are cleared, then the fountains are not working." 
"sent4": "the lighting system is functional." 
"sent5": "If the night patrol is not active, it means that the safety measures and the visibility are not adequate."
"sent6": "If the recreational areas are not accessible and the night patrol is active, the walkways are cleared."
"sent7": "If the park is not open, it means that the recreational areas are not accessible and the night patrol is active."
"sent8": "the garden areas are maintained." 
"sent9": "the emergency exits are accessible." 

Ex 2: Using variables and predicates (UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE)
Input: 
Situation: This problem is about a local community garden.
{a} = tomato plants
{b} = rose bushes
{c} = compost bin
x = types of elements found in a community garden (including plants, flowers, vegetables, trees, compost bins, etc.)
{C} = {variable} needs watering
{D} = {variable} is blooming
{AA} = {variable} attracts bees
{AB} = {variable} is used for educational workshops
{B} = {variable} is newly planted
{A} = {variable} produces vegetables
"hypothesis_formula": "(\u00ac{C}{c} & {D}{c})"
sent1: (\u00ac{AA}{a} & \u00ac{AB}{a}) -> {B}{b}
sent2: (x): \u00ac({B}x & {D}x) -> \u00ac{D}x
sent3: {D}{c}
sent4: \u00ac{A}{c} -> \u00ac{C}{c}
sent5: \u00ac{B}{b}
sent6: \u00ac(\u00ac{AA}{a} & \u00ac{AB}{a}) -> \u00ac{A}{c}

Output: 
"hypothesis": "The compost bin doesn't need watering and is blooming."
"sent1": "If tomato plants do not attract bees and are not used for educational workshops, then rose bushes are newly planted."
"sent2": "For any element in the garden, if it is not newly planted and blooming, then it is not blooming."
"sent3": "The compost bin is blooming."
"sent4": "If the compost bin does not produce vegetables, then it does not need watering."
"sent5": "The rose bushes are not newly planted."
"sent6": "If it is not the case that tomato plants do not attract bees and are not used for educational workshops, then the compost bin does not produce vegetables."

Ex 3: Using variables and predicates and (Ex)
Situation: This problem is about a local gym and its facilities.
{E} = gym is open for 24 hours
{c} = swimming pool
{C} = swimming pool is closed for maintenance
{a} = treadmill area
{D} = personal training sessions are available
{b} = yoga studio
{B} = yoga studio is booked for a private event
{A} = gym membership is active
x = types of gym facilities (including treadmills, swimming pools, yoga studios, etc.)
{AA} = {variable} is currently crowded
{aa} = locker rooms


"hypothesis_formula": "\u00ac{E}{c}"
"context_formula": "sent1: \u00ac{C}{a} -> {D}{b} sent2: (x ): \u00ac{B}x -> \u00ac({A}x & {E}x) sent3: {B}{a} sent4: {A}{a} -> \u00ac{C}{a} sent5: (x): ({A}x v {B}x) -> \u00ac{C}x sent6: {D}{b} -> {E}{c} sent7: ({D}{a} v {C}{a}) sent8: (x): \u00ac({A}x & {E}x) -> \u00ac{E}x sent9: {AA}{aa}"
"proofs_formula": ["sent3 -> int1: ({A}{a} v {B}{a}); sent5 -> int2: ({A}{a} v {B}{a}) -> \u00ac{C}{a}; int1 & int2 -> int3: \u00ac{C}{a}; int3 & sent1 -> int4: {D}{b}; int4 & sent6 -> hypothesis;"]

Output: 
"hypothesis": "The swimming pool is not open for 24 hours." 


Ex 4: Using variables and predicates and (forAll)



Situation: This problem is about morning beverages. 
{AA} = {variable} is caffeinated
{AB} = {variable} is served hot
{A} = {variable} is preferred by the office
{a} = coffee
{x} = types of morning beverages (including coffee, tea, juice, etc.)

Output:
