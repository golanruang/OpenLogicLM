Task: Crate a statement that is either True or False given the context of an arrangement problem. 
Inputs: 
1) A context about the arrangement of several variables. 
2) The meaning of the variables. 
3) All solutions to the problem. 
4) Whether the generated statement should be True or False

Analyze the context, premises, and solutions to generate one True or False question. Write the solutions in english and in logic language.

When generating the queries in logic form, be sure to follow the definitions provided. 

These are the possible logic operations to define a relationship: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

Here are some examples:

Input: 
Context: In a newly discovered solar system called Zeta, astronomers have identified seven celestial bodies of varying sizes, each with unique characteristics. These bodies include three planets, three moons, and a central star. The size of each celestial body has been recorded, establishing a clear hierarchy from smallest to largest. 
Premises: The constraints indicate the relative dimensions: the second celestial body is larger than the fifth, suggesting a moon larger than one of the smaller planets. The third body is smaller than the first, likely a smaller moon orbiting a larger planet. The fourth celestial body is smaller than the seventh, indicating perhaps a moon compared to the system's central star. The sixth celestial body is larger than the first, possibly a larger planet dominating a smaller neighboring one. Lastly, the seventh body, the star, is larger than the third, solidifying its status as the central and most massive object in this system. This classification aids in understanding the physical dynamics and potential habitability of planets within the Zeta system.

Domain:
1: Smallest
7: Largest

Definitions:
var_1: first_celestial_body 
var_2: second_celestial_body 
var_3: third_celestial_body
var_4: fourth_celestial_body
var_5: fifth_celestial_body
var_6: sixth_celestial_body 
var_7: seventh_celestial_body

Solution #1:
third_celestial_body: 2
fourth_celestial_body: 1
fifth_celestial_body: 5 
sixth_celestial_body: 7 
seventh_celestial_body: 3 
first_celestial_body: 4
second_celestial_body: 6

Solution #2:
second_celestial_body: 6
third_celestial_body: 1
fourth_celestial_body: 2
fifth_celestial_body: 5
sixth_celestial_body: 7
seventh_celestial_body: 3
first_celestial_body: 4

Label: True

Output: 
Statement (English): The second celestial body is larger than the seventh celestial body. 

Statement (Logic): second_celestial_body > seventh_celestial_body

Analysis: 
The statement is correct because in solution #1 and solution #2, second_celestial_body > seventh_celestial_body.

Context: In a small town fair, four different varieties of pumpkins are on display for the annual pumpkin contest, each distinct in size. The sizes are ranked from 1 to 4, with 1 being the smallest and 4 the largest. 
Premises: The second variety is larger than the third, suggesting a more mature growth or a different species entirely. The first variety is smaller than the fourth, possibly indicating that the fourth variety is a late-season pumpkin, known for their larger sizes. Interestingly, the second variety is not the smallest, indicating a middle-range size, while the fourth variety, contrary to expectations, is not the largest. This fascinating array of pumpkins, each unique in size, draws the attention of both the townsfolk and the judges, setting the stage for an exciting contest. 

Domain:
1: Smallest
4: Largest

Definitions: 
var_1: first_pumpkin_variety
var_2: second_pumpkin_variety
var_3: third_pumpkin_variety
var_4: fourth_pumpkin_variety

Solution #1:
second_pumpkin_variety: 4
third_pumpkin_variety: 2
fourth_pumpkin_variety: 3
first_pumpkin_variety: 1

Solution #2:
second_pumpkin_variety: 4
third_pumpkin_variety: 1
fourth_pumpkin_variety: 3
first_pumpkin_variety: 2

Solution #3:
second_pumpkin_variety: 4
third_pumpkin_variety: 3
fourth_pumpkin_variety: 2
first_pumpkin_variety: 1

Label: False

Output: 
Statement (English): The first variety of pumpkin is the smallest. 

Statement (Logic): first_pumpkin_variety == 1

Analysis: 
The statement is incorrect because in solution #2, first_pumpkin_variety (2) is not the smallest (1).

Input: 
Context: In a regional basketball league, three players, Tom, Jerry, and Spike, are known for their varying heights which significantly influence their roles and performances on the court. The players are categorized from shortest to tallest. 
Premises: Player Jerry is shorter than player Tom, suggesting that Jerry might be a guard, while Tom could be playing a forward position. Player Spike is taller than Jerry, indicating that Spike could be the team's center. However, Tom is not the tallest player, which suggests that Spike could be taller. Lastly, Spike is not the shortest player, confirming his role as a key player in rebounds and blocks. These height differences play a crucial role in determining the team's strategy and player positions during games.

Domain:
1: Shortest
3: Tallest

Definitions:
var_1: player_Tom
var_2: player_Jerry
var_3: player_Spike

Solution #1:
player_Tom: 2
player_Spike: 3
player_Jerry: 1

Label: True

Output:
