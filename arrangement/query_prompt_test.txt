Input: 
Context: In a newly discovered solar system called Zeta, astronomers have identified seven celestial bodies of varying sizes, each with unique characteristics. These bodies include three planets, three moons, and a central star. The size of each celestial body has been recorded, establishing a clear hierarchy from smallest to largest. 
Premises: The constraints indicate the relative dimensions: the second celestial body is larger than the fifth, suggesting a moon larger than one of the smaller planets. The third body is smaller than the first, likely a smaller moon orbiting a larger planet. The fourth celestial body is smaller than the seventh, indicating perhaps a moon compared to the system's central star. The sixth celestial body is larger than the first, possibly a larger planet dominating a smaller neighboring one. Lastly, the seventh body, the star, is larger than the third, solidifying its status as the central and most massive object in this system. This classification aids in understanding the physical dynamics and potential habitability of planets within the Zeta system.

Query Type: 2 (<)
Statement (English): The third celestial body is smaller than the fifth celestial body. 

Statement (Logic): third_celestial_body < fifth_celestial_body

Analysis: This statement is correct because in solution #1 and solution #2, third_celestial_body < fifth_celestial_body

Query Type: 3 (==) 
Statement (English): The sixth celestial body is the largest celestial body.

Statement (Logic): sixth_celestial_body == 7

Analysis: This statement is correct because in solution #1 and solution #2, sixth_celestial_body == 7.

Query Type: 4 (!=)
Statement (English): The first celestial body is not the second smallest celestial body.

Statement (Logic): first_celestial_body != 2

Analysis: This statement is correct because in solution #1 and solution #2, first_celestial_body != 2.

Query Type: 5 (>=)
Statement (English): The fourth celestial body is larger than or equal to the smallest celestial body.

Statement (Logic): fourth_celestial_body >= 1

Analysis: This statement is correct because in solution #1 and solution #2, fourth_celestial_body >= 1.

Query Type: 6 (<=)
Statement (English): The third celestial body is smaller than or equal to the second smallest celestial body.

Statement (Logic): third_celestial_body <= 2

Analysis: This statement is correct because in solution #1 and solution #2, third_celestial_body <= 2.

Input: 
Context: In a small town fair, four different varieties of pumpkins are on display for the annual pumpkin contest, each distinct in size. The sizes are ranked from 1 to 4, with 1 being the smallest and 4 the largest. 
Premises: The second variety is larger than the third, suggesting a more mature growth or a different species entirely. The first variety is smaller than the fourth, possibly indicating that the fourth variety is a late-season pumpkin, known for their larger sizes. Interestingly, the second variety is not the smallest, indicating a middle-range size, while the fourth variety, contrary to expectations, is not the largest. This fascinating array of pumpkins, each unique in size, draws the attention of both the townsfolk and the judges, setting the stage for an exciting contest. 

Context: In a corporate hierarchy of an international company, six roles are identified within the organization's structure, from the lowest position to the highest rank. The ranking of each role is essential to establish the decision-making process, lines of command, and determine the distribution of responsibilities.
Premises: Role E is higher in rank than Role D, indicating that Role E might hold more responsibility or authority within the company. Role A is lower in rank than Role C, signifying that Role C might supervise or manage Role A. Role B has been identified as the fourth highest in the structure, potentially a senior management role. Meanwhile, Role F holds the second lowest position, perhaps an entry-level role or a recent recruit. Role C is higher in rank than Role B, suggesting that Role C might be part of the company's top executives, while Role D is lower than Role F, denoting that Role D is possibly an intern or in a similar category.

Output: 
Query Type: 1 (>)
Statement (English): Role F is higher than Role A. 

Statement (Logic): role_F > role_A 

Analysis: This statement is incorrect because in solution #1, solution #2, and solution #3, role_F <= role_A.

Query Type: 2 (<)
Statement (English): Role B is lower than Role E 

Statement (Logic): role_B < role_E

Analysis: This statement is incorrect because in solution #1, role_B >= role_E.

Query Type: 3 (==)
Statement (English): Role A is the third lowest role. 

Statement (Logic): role_A == 3 

Analysis: This statement is incorrect because in solution #1, role_A != 3.

Query Type: 4 (!=)
Statement (English): Role D is not the lowest role. 

Statement (Logic): role_D != 2

Analysis: This statement is incorrect because in solution #1, solution #2, and solution #3, role_D == 2.

Query Type: 5 (>=)
Statement (English): Role E is higher than or equal to Role C.

Statement (Logic): role_E >= role_C

Analysis: This statement is incorrect because in solution #1 and solution #3, role_E < role_C.

Query Type: 6 (<=)
Statement (English): Role F is lower than or equal to the lowest role. 

Statement (Logic): role_F <= 1

Analysis: This statement is incorrect because in solution #1, solution #2, and solution #3, role_F > 1.

Input: 
Context: In a prestigious international art auction, five unique sculptures are being ranked based on their size from smallest to largest. These sculptures, each crafted by renowned artists, vary in size and complexity, adding to the intrigue and suspense of the auction. 
Premises: The constraints reveal the relative sizes of the sculptures: The first sculpture is smaller than the second, suggesting it may be a delicate piece of miniature art. The second sculpture is smaller than the third - perhaps a medium-sized work of art that is still manageable to transport. The third sculpture is smaller than the fourth, signaling a shift towards larger, more imposing pieces. Finally, the fourth sculpture is smaller than the fifth, which is presumably the grandest and most commanding piece in the collection. These sizes not only affect the spectacle of the auction but also the potential value of these exquisite works of art.
