Context: In a prestigious international art auction, five unique sculptures are being ranked based on their size from smallest to largest. These sculptures, each crafted by renowned artists, vary in size and complexity, adding to the intrigue and suspense of the auction. 

Premises: The constraints reveal the relative sizes of the sculptures: The first sculpture is smaller than the second, suggesting it may be a delicate piece of miniature art. The second sculpture is smaller than the third - perhaps a medium-sized work of art that is still manageable to transport. The third sculpture is smaller than the fourth, signaling a shift towards larger, more imposing pieces. Finally, the fourth sculpture is smaller than the fifth, which is presumably the grandest and most commanding piece in the collection. These sizes not only affect the spectacle of the auction but also the potential value of these exquisite works of art.
