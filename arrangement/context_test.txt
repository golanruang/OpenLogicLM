Context: In a botanical garden, six different species of flowers are arranged based on their height, from smallest to largest. These include three types of roses, two types of tulips, and a sunflower. Each species has a unique height, contributing to the garden's beauty and diversity.
Premises: The first flower species is smaller than the second, suggesting perhaps a rose smaller than a tulip. The second flower species is smaller than the third, likely another taller tulip. However, the third species is larger than the fourth, and the fourth species is larger than the fifth, indicating a descending order among perhaps the roses and the sunflower. Surprisingly, the sixth species, potentially another variation of rose, is smaller than the fifth but larger than the first. Though not the smallest, the second flower species is not the fourth largest, and while not the largest, the fifth species is not the second smallest.

Domain:
1: Smallest
6: Largest

Variables:
first_flower [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
second_flower [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
third_flower [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
fourth_flower [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
fifth_flower [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
sixth_flower [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Constraints:
first_flower < second_flower ::: first_flower is smaller than second_flower
second_flower < third_flower ::: second_flower is smaller than third_flower
third_flower > fourth_flower ::: third_flower is larger than fourth_flower
fourth_flower > fifth_flower ::: fourth_flower is larger than fifth_flower
sixth_flower < fifth_flower ::: sixth_flower is smaller than fifth_flower
sixth_flower > first_flower ::: sixth_flower is larger than first_flower
second_flower != 4 ::: second_flower is not the fourth largest
fifth_flower != 2 ::: fifth_flower is not the second smallest
